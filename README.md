# Html FundMe Project

This is a project based on the FreeCodeCamp tutorial

This project is the front end of the Hardhat Fundme Project.

To run it:

1. Download Live Server Extension on your VSCode editor
2. Launch Live Server (At the bottom right of VSCode)
3. In a separate VSCode, Launch the Hardhat Fundme Projetct & run "yarn hardhat node" command in the command prompt for a local deployment
4. Once launched, copy the private key of the first account generated by hardhat and paste it in the .env file
5. In your Metamask browser, click "Add Account" option, select "private key" and paste the previously copied private key
6. If a nonce problem occur, reset your metamask wallet by doing Settings -> Advanced Settings -> Reset Account
7. After that, you'll normally be able to fund and withdraw the smart contract
